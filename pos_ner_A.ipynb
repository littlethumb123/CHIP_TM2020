    "#### Part of Speech Tagging Basics\n",
    "Part of Speech (POS) Tagging is one of the most fundamental tasks in NLP. It aims to identify the grammatical function each word plays in a sentence, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.  \n",
    "For example, we want to parse the following sentence.  \n",
    "*The field of health IT is diverse, rapidly changing, and covers numerous areas of scholarship* -- CHIP website\n",

    "It looks cool but why we need POS tagging? We already have information about words from a text using tokenization and why we still need the information about grammatical constructs? POS tagging in fact helps us with many tasks, such as\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Word sense disambiguition\n",
    "A word can have multiple senses. For example, \"I like playing video games\" and \"Peter looks like his grandfather\", the \"like\" in two sentences is used as a verb and preposition, respectively. Using POS tags, we can easily idenitfy such difference, rather than infering it from its meaning which is often more computationally complex.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Identify key components in a text\n",
    "Noun Phrase is a key components to prepresent either subject or object in a document and thus indicate informative content in texts. Another example we can think about is the intensive use of adjectives and adverb in sentiment analysis, which indicates sentenceâ€™s polarity, i.e., positive, neutral and negative . The  POS tag can help use identify such syntactic structures easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we will take a taste of parsing a text with NLTK and complete the following tasks\n",
    "* Tag each word with syntactic categories\n",
    "* Extract noun, verb and prepositional phrases\n",
    "* Parse sentence to explore its dependency relations among words\n"
