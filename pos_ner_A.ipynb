Part of Speech Tagging Basics\nPart of Speech (POS) Tagging is one of the most fundamental tasks in NLP. It aims to identify the grammatical function each word plays in a sentence, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.  \nFor example, we want to parse the following sentence.  \n*The field of health IT is diverse, rapidly changing, and covers numerous areas of scholarship* -- CHIP website\n\n|Word|POS tags|Meaning|Word|POS tags|Meaning|\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|The|DT|Determiner|changing|VBG|Verb, gerund or present participle|\n|field|NN|Noun, singular or mass|and|CC|Coordinating conjunction|\n|of|IN|Preposition or subordinating conjunction|covers|VBZ|Verb, 3rd person singular present|\n|health|NN|Noun, singular or mass|numerous|JJ|Adjective|\n|IT|NNP|Proper noun, singular|areas|NNS|Noun, plural| \n|is|VBZ|Verb, 3rd person singular present|of|IN|Preposition or subordinating conjunction\n|diverse|JJ|Adjective|scholarship|NN|Noun, singular or mass|\n|rapidly|RB|Adverb|\n\nIt looks cool but why we need POS tagging? We already have information about words from a text using tokenization and why we still need the information about grammatical constructs? POS tagging in fact helps us with many tasks, such as\n\n1) Word sense disambiguition\nA word can have multiple senses. For example, \"I like playing video games\" and \"Peter looks like his grandfather\", the \"like\" in two sentences is used as a verb and preposition, respectively. Using POS tags, we can easily idenitfy such difference, rather than infering it from its meaning which is often more computationally complex.  \n\n2) Identify key components in a text\nNoun Phrase is a key components to prepresent either subject or object in a document and thus indicate informative content in texts. Another example we can think about is the intensive use of adjectives and adverb in sentiment analysis, which indicates sentenceâ€™s polarity, i.e., positive, neutral and negative . The  POS tag can help use identify such syntactic structures easily.\n\nIn the following, we will take a taste of parsing a text with NLTK and complete the following tasks\n* Tag each word with syntactic categories\n* Extract noun, verb and prepositional phrases\n* Parse sentence to explore its dependency relations among words\n\n#### Examples","metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%% md\n"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import nltk\nfrom nltk import word_tokenize, pos_tag, RegexpParser\nfrom nltk.parse import CoreNLPParser\nfrom Util.pos_ner_helper import getNP\n\nTEXT_SAMPLE = \"\"\" Health informatics is information engineering applied to the field of health care, \n                essentially the management and use of patient health care information \"\"\"\n\n\n# Tokenize the text\ntext_tokens = word_tokenize(TEXT_SAMPLE)\n\n# Obtain tags\ntags = pos_tag(text_tokens)   # 1\nprint(\"The pos tags of the given text: {}\".format(tags))\n\n# Noun phrase regex pattern:            #2\nnp_phrase = r\"\"\"\n            NP: {<DT>?<JJ>+<NN.*>}    \n                {<NN.*>{2,}}    \n            \"\"\"\n# RegexpParser parses the tags and visualize the grammatical structure\nparser = RegexpParser(np_phrase)      #3\nparser_res = parser.parse(tags)                   #4\nprint(\"The parse result is drawn here\")\nparser_res.draw()   \n\n# Collect noun phrase from the parsing results\nNP_list = getNP(parser_res)\nprint(\"The extracted noun phrases are {}\".format(NP_list))","metadata":{"collapsed":false,"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n","is_executing":false},"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"trusted":true},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mModuleNotFoundError\u001b[0m                       Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m<ipython-input-3-adbaeaf99e15>\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<module>\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 1\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0;32mimport\u001b[0m \u001b[0mnltk\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m      2\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mfrom\u001b[0m \u001b[0mnltk\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mimport\u001b[0m \u001b[0mword_tokenize\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0mpos_tag\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0mRegexpParser\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      3\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mfrom\u001b[0m \u001b[0mnltk\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mparse\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mimport\u001b[0m \u001b[0mCoreNLPParser\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      4\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mfrom\u001b[0m \u001b[0mUtil\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mpos_ner_helper\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mimport\u001b[0m \u001b[0mgetNP\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      5\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[0;31mModuleNotFoundError\u001b[0m: No module named 'nltk'"],"ename":"ModuleNotFoundError","evalue":"No module named 'nltk'","output_type":"error"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 2.
